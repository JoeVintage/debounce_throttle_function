## About

CommonStreamUtils extends the capabilities of Dart Streams and RxDart.

Dart comes with decent and powerful Streams API out-of-the-box,but they are clumsy to implement some features like:debounce„ÄÅthrottle

Now you can use it easily and gracefully in just one line of code!

## Getting started

Easy To Use,Graceful To Use! 

## Features

|  Function   | Purpose  |
|  ----  | ----  |
| Throttle  | 	Wait for changes to stop before notifying. |
| Debounce  | 	Notifies once per Duration for a value that keeps changing. |

## Usage

For Example: throttle user button click down to 1000milliseconds(1 click per second)

```dart
                  onPressed: () {
CommonStreamUtils.throttleFunction(() {
InviteDialog().showInviteBottomSheet(
context,
memberMainPageLogic.memberShipLevel.value,
inviteDialogLogic);
},milliseconds: 1000);
},
```

For Example: debounce user button click down to 1000milliseconds(1 click per second)

```dart
                  onPressed: () {
CommonStreamUtils.debounceFunction(() {
InviteDialog().showInviteBottomSheet(
context,
memberMainPageLogic.memberShipLevel.value,
inviteDialogLogic);
},milliseconds: 1000);
},
```
